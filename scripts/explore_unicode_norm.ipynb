    "Before we start, a small reminder on Unicode.\n",
    "Unicode is a versioned standard.\n",
    "In 2025, the latest version is Unicode 17.0.\n",
    "It defines over a million code points, of which around 150,000 are assigned characters.\n",
    "Some of them belong to \"bicameral\" scripts (like Latin, Greek, Cyrillic) that have distinct uppercase and lowercase forms.\n",
    "Others belong to \"unicameral\" scripts (like Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic) that do not have case distinctions.\n",
    "It doesn't, however, mean that there are no different ways to represent the same character in the same script.\n",
    "So \"case folding\" and \"normalization\" are two different concepts.\n",
    "We will explore both in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unicode also doesn't require UTF-8 encoding, but UTF-8 is the most popular encoding on the web and in modern applications and the one we will focus on in StringZilla.\n",
    "In UTF-8, each code point is represented by one, two, three, or four bytes.\n",
    "A folded or normalized character can map to a sequence of multiple code points, and each of those code points can have a different length representation in UTF-8.\n",
    "That's why, in the absolute majority of modern text-processing applications full Unicode processing is disabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, when people perform case-insensitive search, they either:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use simple ASCII case folding (A-Z to a-z), ignoring all other characters.\n",
    "2. Use pretty much the only major library that supports full Unicode case folding and normalization, ICU (International Components for Unicode).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is clearly insufficient, and the second is quite heavy and works at a character level, making SIMD optimizations difficult.\n",
    "This notebook will focus on more SIMD-vectorizable ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, let's pull the most recent Unicode Character Database (UCD) files from the Unicode website."
