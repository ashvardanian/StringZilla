# StringZilla ü¶ñ

StringZilla is the Godzilla of string libraries, splitting, sorting, and shuffling large textual datasets faster than you can say "Tokyo Tower" üòÖ

- ‚úÖ Single-header pure C 99 implementation [docs](#quick-start-c-üõ†Ô∏è)
- ‚úÖ [Direct CPython bindings](https://ashvardanian.com/posts/pybind11-cpython-tutorial/) with minimal call latency [docs](#quick-start-python-üêç)
- ‚úÖ [SWAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAR) and [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data) acceleration on x86 (AVX2) and ARM (NEON)
- ‚úÖ [Radix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort)-like sorting faster than C++ `std::sort`
- ‚úÖ [Memory-mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_file) to work with larger-than-RAM datasets
- ‚úÖ Memory-efficient compressed arrays to work with sequences
- üîú JavaScript bindings are on their way.

This library saved me tens of thousands of dollars pre-processing large datasets for machine learning, even on the scale of a single experiment.
So if you want to process the 6 Billion images from [LAION](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/), or the 250 Billion web pages from the [CommonCrawl](https://commoncrawl.org/), or even just a few million lines of server logs, and haunted by Python's `open(...).readlines()` and `str().splitlines()` taking forever, this should help üòä

## Performance

StringZilla is built on a very simple heuristic:

> If the first 4 bytes of the string are the same, the strings are likely to be equal.
> Similarly, the first 4 bytes of the strings can be used to determine their relative order most of the time.

Thanks to that it can avoid scalar code processing one `char` at a time and use hyper-scalar code to achieve `memcpy` speeds.
__The implementation fits into a single C 99 header file__ and uses different SIMD flavors and SWAR on older platforms.
